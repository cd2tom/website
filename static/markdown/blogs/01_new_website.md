# New website (first website)

###### 01-27-2019

Hi, this is my new website and it's actually the first personal website I've built!

It's written in React using Parcel as the bundler and most of the content is driven by markdown files. You can read more about the tech [here.](/projects/new-website)

I wanted a really flat and minimalist design and I ended up with this drab look. I kinda like it. I was gonna use some pastel colours but I couldn't get the right feel.

The main reason I made this website is that I wanna get better at coding and have stuff to show for it. To paraphrase some smarter people than me, the best way to get better at something is to do more of it.

I saw Dan Abramov's [cool blog](https://overreacted.io/) and I wanted to have something similar. That blog was built using a Gatsby template which is neat but I thought it would be cool to build it from scratch.

I will work on more side projects and hopefully post about them here when I finish them. There's tons of stuff I wanna learn more about. The one thing I wanna play around with is GraphQL so it'd be cool to set up an api/front-end to learn about it.

I was thinking about making a React/GraphQL/Express imageboard rip-off: TomChan.

Or a Reddit clone: Tommit!

Maybe a basic GraphQL driven e-commerce engine.

Something neat!
