# About

Hi! My name is Tom! I am a Javascript front-end developer.

I've been a pro developer for 3+ years now. My first experience with programming was creating a hacked Minecraft client in Java. I actually learnt something about programming with C# at school and then with a bit of Python in my spare time.

I mainly used Python to crawl websites to get stats about tennis players. My first (and current) job was being a Ruby on Rails guy but that gradually transitioned to React/Node.

I want to learn more React/Javascript/front-end/coding things so I made this website! The main goal of this is to play around and show off stuff that I make.

More personal stuff: I'm 25. I like music. I like reading. I like exercising. I like walking. I like writing and drawing.

One day, I hope to be a coding wizard, an ultra runner and look like Henry Cavill.
