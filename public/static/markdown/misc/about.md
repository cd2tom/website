Hi. My name is Tom. I am a Javascript developer.

I've been a developer for 4+ years now. My first experience with programming was creating a hacked Minecraft client in Java. I actually learnt something about programming with C# at school. I messed around with Python as well. I mainly used Python to crawl websites to get stats about tennis players.

My first (and current) job was being a Ruby on Rails guy but that gradually transitioned to React/Node.

I want to learn more React/Javascript/front-end/back-end/languages/coding things so I made this website! The main goal of this is to play around like a blank canvas to have some kind of archive of stuff I've messed with.

More personal stuff: I'm 27. I like loads of music but I'm very partial to weird indie stuff. My fave artists are John Maus/Animal Collective/Bob Dylan/Joy Division. I like reading. My favourite books are Crime and Punishment and East of Eden though I also love who dunnits. I like football and am a bit obsessed with FPL. I like exercising and walking. I like writing and drawing.

Ambitions: become a cyclist/learn french.
