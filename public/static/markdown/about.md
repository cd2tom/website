# About

Hi! My name is Tom Finney. I am a Javascript front-end developer and this is my mad website.

I've been a developer for 2+ years now. Originally, I was a Ruby on Rails guy but the company I work for gradually transitioned to using React and ultimately, a full Javascript stack.

I want to learn more React/Javascript/front-end/coding things so I made this website! The main goal of this is to motivate me to make cool stuff so building a personal website from the ground up seemed like a good starting point.

If you wanna read more about why I made this website, [click here!](/blogs/new-website) If you wanna read about technical stuff driving this website, [click here!](/projects/new-website)

More personal stuff: I'm 24. I like music. I like reading. I like exercising. I like walking. I like writing and drawing.

One day I hope to be a coding wizard, ultra runner and chill dude.
